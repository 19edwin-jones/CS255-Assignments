### "Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?"
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The DriverPass project was a web-based application that aimed to provide student drivers with resources and opportunities to prepare for their DMV written and driving tests.
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; The clients of DriverPass, Liam and Ian, are the owner and IT officer respectively. They wanted a system that users could access at anytime and from anywhere. To avoid adding the additional responsibility of managing and maintaining their own self-hosted server, they wanted to have the web application hosted in the cloud using one of the several options available. This was important to not only the way they wanted the system to operate and function, but to also allow them to dedicate their time to their business.

### "What did you do particularly well?"
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; With the system design, I believe that I was able to provide them with a good foundation they could add on to and scale as needed with minimal downtime and work required which was an important aspect to consider as this ensured the system was available to users nearly all the time. Not only was the system able to adapt, but I believe I incorporated designs and components that ensured security for the system and the users. I made sure to weave security into their requirements as DriverPass would be handling sensitive information.

### "If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?"
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I would focus on finding more use cases that weren't explicitly stated. This includes implementing a customer service page and ticket processing. I would also look more into the pros and cons of using a web-based platform versus self-hosting. Costs of hardware, storage, internet and internet speeds, energy consumption and cost, maintenance costs, and downtime, to name a few, can become quite high especially as the service grows and the economy changes. These factors would influence a lot of decisions in terms of the platforms to choose. And if given more details from DriverPass through discussions and questions, I could make more informed choices understanding their budget, skill, time, employees, space, and location.

### "How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?"
&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I interpreted the user's needs as something that should heavily influence decisions. Everything DriverPass wanted and required were all components in making sure the user's experience was the best it could be. I made sure that the design decisions I made supported at least one user need either directly or indirectly. The system is at its core, is for the user. This makes the user's needs the most important thing to fulfill. If the user experience and expectations aren't met, it discourages them from returning to the software or from using it regularly.

### "How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?"

&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; I made decisions based on my own general expectations for a webapp and software that made me not even think about the system's design because it was intuitive and provided me with all the necessary functions.
